# Fake Face Detection Using CNN

## Overview
This project aims to detect fake faces using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The implementation is done using Python and TensorFlow, and the model is trained and tested on Google Colab using Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Preprocessing of facial images
- Training a CNN model to detect fake faces
- Evaluation of model performance
- Visualization of results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Google Colab

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model can be downloaded from [insert link to dataset]. Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and unzipped in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Google Account (for accessing Google Colab)
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-face-detection-cnn.git
   ```

2. **Upload the Repository to Google Colab**
   - Open Google Colab in your web browser.
   - Upload the cloned repository to your Google Drive.

3. **Open the Notebook**
   - In Google Colab, open the Jupyter Notebook file `fake_face_detection.ipynb` from the cloned repository.

4. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Ensure the notebook has the necessary library installations:
   ```python
   !pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python
   ```

5. **Load and Preprocess Data**
   - Ensure the dataset is available in the correct directory.
   - Follow the steps in the notebook to load and preprocess the data.

6. **Train the Model**
   - Run the cells in the notebook to train the CNN model.

7. **Evaluate the Model**
   - Use the provided evaluation methods in the notebook to assess model performance.

8. **Visualize Results**
